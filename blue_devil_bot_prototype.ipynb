      "\n",
      "### Ingredients:\n",
      "- 3 ripe bananas\n",
      "- 2 cups milk\n",
      "- 1/2 cup sugar\n",
      "- 1/4 cup cornstarch\n",
      "- 1/4 teaspoon salt\n",
      "- 2 large eggs\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n",
      "- Whipped cream (optional)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Directions:\n",
      "1. **Make the Pudding:**\n",
      "   - In a saucepan, mix sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Gradually whisk in the milk until smooth.\n",
      "   - Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens and bubbles, about 7-10 minutes.\n",
      "   - In a separate bowl, lightly beat the eggs. Gradually whisk about 1/2 cup of the hot milk mixture into the eggs to temper them, so they won’t curdle.\n",
      "   - Pour the egg mixture back into the saucepan with the rest of the milk mixture, stirring constantly.\n",
      "   - Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, for another 2-3 minutes until the pudding is thick and creamy.\n",
      "   - Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Assemble the Pudding:**\n",
      "   - Slice the bananas into rounds.\n",
      "   - In serving dishes or a large bowl, layer the bananas and pour the warm pudding over them.\n",
      "   - Repeat layers until all components are used up.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Chill and Serve:**\n",
      "   - Cover the pudding with plastic wrap, pressing it directly onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming.\n",
      "   - Refrigerate for at least 2-3 hours or until set.\n",
      "   - Before serving, top with whipped cream if desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Substitute Tip:\n",
      "If you miss the texture of vanilla wafers, you can substitute with crushed graham crackers, shortbread, or even cookies like biscotti for a crunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoy your homemade banana pudding! \n",
